### üí° About Me

I am a **passionate software engineer** with experience in **software development**, **automation**, and **testing**. Over the years, I‚Äôve worked on various projects, primarily focusing on **back-end development** with technologies such as **JavaScript**, **Java**, and **Python**. I have also contributed to **open-source projects** and collaborated with talented developers worldwide.

I thrive on **solving complex problems** and finding **elegant, scalable solutions**. I enjoy the process of turning ideas into tangible, efficient software. My technical interests include **cloud computing**, **microservices architecture**, **DevOps**, and the evolving field of **GenAI tools**, and I am constantly exploring ways to make software engineering more efficient and scalable. I enjoy using tools like **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **CI/CD pipelines** to automate processes and ensure high-quality software delivery.

Outside of coding, I enjoy learning about new technologies, participating in tech communities, and mentoring others. I'm always eager to learn new things, whether it's a new programming language, clicking weird pictures, or exploring a development methodology.
